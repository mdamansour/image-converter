# Privacy Policy

## Our Commitment

**Your privacy is not negotiable.** This application was built from the ground up with privacy as the absolute top priority.

## What We Don't Do

- ❌ **No file uploads** - Your images never leave your device
- ❌ **No cloud storage** - We don't have servers to store anything
- ❌ **No user accounts** - No sign-up, no login, no tracking
- ❌ **No file metadata collection** - We don't know what you convert
- ❌ **No third-party sharing** - There's nothing to share

## How It Actually Works

### 1. File Selection
When you select or drag files into the application:
- Files are read directly into your browser's memory
- They never touch our servers (we don't have any!)
- File data stays entirely on your device

### 2. Image Processing
All conversion happens using your browser's built-in Canvas API:
- Your CPU does all the processing work
- Conversion happens in browser memory
- No external services are called for processing

### 3. Download
Converted files are:
- Generated in your browser's memory
- Downloaded directly to your device
- Never stored anywhere else

## Technical Transparency

This application is **100% open source**. You can:
- [View all source code on GitHub](https://github.com/mdamansour/image-converter)
- Inspect the code yourself
- See exactly what the application does
- Fork it and run your own version

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- **Processing**: HTML5 Canvas API
- **Storage**: LocalStorage (settings only, never files)
- **Architecture**: Client-side only, no backend

## What We Store Locally

The application uses browser LocalStorage **only** for:
- Your preferred output format
- Quality settings
- Resize preferences

These settings:
- Stay on your device
- Can be cleared anytime
- Don't contain any file data
- Are never transmitted anywhere

## Open Source = Trust

Unlike proprietary converters, every line of code is public and auditable:
- No hidden tracking scripts
- No obfuscated code
- No secret server calls
- Complete transparency
